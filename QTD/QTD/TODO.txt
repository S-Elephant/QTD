- instead of just <Animation> add stand, walk, attack, die animations and add a corpse texture... nah wait this must be done in the factory. Create different kinds of animations there for that type.
- flying enemies can not be blocked for now and flying enemies have no weapons.
- GUI
	- find texture for the next-wave-spawn-bar-progress
- write readme.
- add bank building? allows gold pile to be build? generates a little gold.
- add tower smoke visuals and other visuals by xml when shooting for the baseweapon.
	- finish the visual class and pool it in the level class. problem is to create animations w/o garbage. prolly needs eVisual or something as enum.
	- i am considering of only adding a few visuals or something.... nah i dont know how the fuck to pool simpleasprites...
- add special projectile arrow that has 8 directions or just gets a rotation in the draw method. prolly  the last one.
- need simple editor
	- load/save bg
	- load/save waypoints
	- screw the rest. the rest is done in xml or something.

Bugs:
-[fixed] defenders dont split up from 1 target to multiple targets.
-[probably fixed now] defenders sometimes keep chasing enemies out of range?
-[fixed?] sometimes enemies dont attack the 2nd defender after it killed the first one. it does however stay in place...
- defender still keeps attacking sometimes.. but when the runner returns they continue battle.

busy:
- Add modifiers
        public bool ImmuneStun;
        public bool ImmuneSlow;
        public bool ImmuneArmorReduction;
        public bool ImmuneRooted;


	- add upgrade delay
		- add bar to each tower as upgrade bar
		- while upgrading remove all buttons on tower.... fuck this shit.... upgrading a tower is too annoying.
			- what if it is supplying and the user cancels the upgrade? or do we give back the supply and charge 50% of the upg cost anyway?
				- then the upgrade must have a cancel button.

AfterCare:
- Allow damage aura's on towers and defenders and enemies
- runners with 50% transparancy as ghost type?
- add another cost type like instead of just gold also silver and make towers that generate silver.
- add ugprade delay with blue upgrade bar instead of instant upgrading a tower.

Features:
- Runners may restart at the start after reaching the finish.
- Almost everything including the towers and their upgrades are created from XML and are thus highly customizable.
- Camera 2D.
- Towers and upgrades.
- Waypoints that allow multiple paths.
- Knows the statistics about the runners like the % completed route.
- Defenders. Units that are spawned by a tower and gather arround a rally point. They block one enemy each and try to kill it.
- Rallypoints have their own ranges from the tower and each rallypoint has a range for their defenders to gather around it.
- Waypoint spread: runners do not exactly follow the waypoint lines but randomly spread out.
- Towers may generate gold when a wave spawns and/or every x millisecond.
- Critical and income floating texts.
- Fully working and dynamically (pre-)generated minimap that responds to the mouse, hideable, etc.
- Towers either have a supply upkeep or cost supply.
- The first wave doesn't spawn untill the player hit the button to force the next spawn. This allows the player to get a look at the map and build his/her first towers in peace.
- Certain towers may require another tower to be built and still present before it may be build.
- Towers can be sold dor half their total value including upgrades.
- Buildable towers can be allowed or disallowed for each specific level for each tower if desired.
	- Category buttons that have no available towers are disabled (invisible).
- Allows custom tiles. The engine merges the tiles into bigger tiles of 2048x2048 and only draws the visible area of those.
